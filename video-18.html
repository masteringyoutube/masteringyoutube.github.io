                    <p>Welcome to Section 5, and the last section of our YouTube Live Step-by-Step Video Training.</p>

                    <p>In this section, we will be showing you: What things should you do and not do with YouTube Live? Tips to Improve Live Streaming, and How you can have someone else do the hard work for you.</p>

                    <p>What things should you do and not do with YouTube Live?</p>

                    <p>As much as you might now know about live streaming and, specifically, about using YouTube for live streaming, one has to always learn to recognize that some things can go unnoticed right under our noses.</p>

                    <p>These are usually the small things, but the small things are always going to be important to look after, and because we truly believe that your success is also our success, we have decided to give you a handy summary of those things that you should do and the things that you should not do with YouTube live.</p>

                    <p>Stream original content</p>

                    <p>It goes without saying that there is something beside you that your viewers go after when they access your live streams, and that is your content. Work hard on creating an original character and content, as non-original content tends to saturate YouTube rather fast!</p>

                    <p>Take good care of your camera and setup</p>

                    <p>Your content might be original and you might make an awesome host, but no one will ever want to tune in to a live stream if it looks like an old and grainy movie! so make sure to create the proper ambiance and present a proper camera setup for your live streams!</p>

                    <p>Interact and collaborate</p>

                    <p>Never forget to interact with your audience! having live chat active during your streams and commenting on the live comments from time to time will reap you great rewards in terms of audience growth, and collaborating with other YouTubers by way of mentions and co-hosting events as well!</p>

                    <p>Take good care of the technicalities</p>

                    <p>The seemingly hardest parts of live streaming such as encoding, analytics and equipment really shouldn’t be difficult at all. Just take your time to familiarize yourself with everything and see how some months from now you will be handling the technical aspects like a TV studio pro!</p>

                    <p>Keep your Channel relevant to your keywords</p>

                    <p>It is very important that the keywords that you use to describe your videos and your channel are congruent to what you actually offer on them. This is so visitors can better relate to your content through their searches and see the value in your channel!</p>

                    <p>Make sure that your channel is visually attractive</p>

                    <p>Never underestimate how powerful your looks can be, and always remember that first impressions matter! Every visual aspect in your channel, from your profile image and your banner to your thumbnails and channel previews are all important and deserve all of your attention!</p>

                    <p>Monitor and track your channel</p>

                    <p>Use YouTube analytics and take advantage of it. Try to get the most out of all the data that it gives you right on your channel dashboard. Use this data to further define your audience.</p>

                    <p>Make good use of donation cards</p>

                    <p>Once you have an active audience, introduce donation cards in your streams. Let your viewers know that donations are destined to making your content better, as donations can be great when you talk about stuff that needs to be accessed through money, such as when you review products. </p>

                    <p>Now for the don’ts...</p>

                    <p>Don’t ever start a stream without testing</p>

                    <p>This can be a costly omission! making sure that everything is running fine, from your encoder to your cameras to your internet connection and firewall settings, and that you are not live while you test, can save you many a headache along the way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Don’t play too much with the settings</p>

                    <p>Always use the recommended settings on your encoder and on your channel configuration, especially at the beginning. Get yourself used to the platform first, then start customizing gradually.</p>

                    <p>Don’t use unrelated tags for your videos</p>

                    <p>Some streamers use popular keywords as tags for their videos to attract more traffic, but that is not recommended. Misleading people into watching your events can get you flagged easily and it will not help viewers to find your content, as tagging your videos with over-searched keywords can bury them among irrelevant results.</p>

                    <p>Don’t live stream too many times a week</p>

                    <p>If what you want is to create an audience that follows your content religiously, you cannot be on air every day, because your audience will eventually get bored. It can also cause you to lower the quality of your content in the rush to get your streams out there fast. Limit yourself to two or three streams a week. </p>

                    <p>Don’t ever buy traffic to your events</p>

                    <p>Do you think that nobody will notice if you buy your backlinks to get your event on top? Think again. Google’s anti-spam algorithms are very, very sophisticated and can detect bogus comments even if they are posted by a real person using a real account. They are also good at tracking where traffic comes from, so focus on getting organic traffic and backlinks. </p>

                    <p>Don’t focus on number of views only</p>

                    <p>We will admit that having thousands of views feels pretty good, but number of views is not the only metric that you should be monitoring as other metrics such as weekly subscribers can be a greater source of information, which will also depend on your goals. </p>

                    <p>Don’t show only your most popular videos at the top</p>

                    <p>You have to think first about what your intended audience wants when placing a top video for the visitors to your channel to see. A video can get popular by several reasons, like for example because of something that you said that went viral for a week, but it will not necessarily represent what you offer to your audience.</p>

                    <p>Don’t ignore feedback</p>

                    <p>That is, all kinds of feedback. Among the inflammatory and the overtly enthusiastic, there is always honest feedback to be found from your viewers, and that feedback, whether it is of your liking or not, is the greatest tool for improvement if what you want is to really give your viewers what they are asking for!</p>

                    <p>Lastly, don’t forget to adhere to this list of do’s and don’ts if you want to save yourself some unavoidable rookie mistakes and at the same time start on the right side of the bed!</p>
