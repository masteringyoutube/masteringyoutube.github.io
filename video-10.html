            <p>Welcome to Section 3 of our YouTube Live Step-by-Step
              Video Training.</p>
            <p>In this section, we will be showing you: Quick Top
              Ranking Tricks by using Money Keywords, by Using Your Name
              or Business Name, by Using Product Names, by Using Product
              Launches, and by Replacing Old Ranked Videos.</p>
            <p>Quick-Top-Ranking Tricks by using Money Keywords</p>
            <p>When you launch a live event or a video on YouTube, one
              of the hardest things to come by is usually the name that
              you are going to give it.</p>
            <p>In fact, naming any type of product, be it a YouTube
              video or a cool gadget or website is a difficult task that
              can mean the difference between getting a very popular or
              a very unpopular product.</p>
            <p>Having a good name for your YouTube video or live event
              is essential because it will help you to rank high on top
              of YouTube and Google searches.</p>
            <p>The common strategy is to name your YouTube stuff with
              the intention of getting it a high ranking while
              leveraging the named videos that already exist. </p>
            <p>But a very important fact to consider, with this as with
              the following videos talking about the Quick Top Ranking
              power of YouTube Live, is that you must make sure people
              are actively using those words you are planning to use to
              name your videos, on Google and on YouTube.</p>
            <p>For that, there is an awesome strategy we will show you
              now, which is called Money Keyword Research.</p>
            <p>First of all, you must make sure that there is an active
              audience looking for a particular subject over the web.</p>
            <p>As we want to rank in Google, and YouTube, we can simply
              use the keyword tool Google actually gives you free access
              to, so you can find out what people are actually searching
              for in Google.com, and that tool is called the Keyword
              Planner.</p>
            <p>To get to that tool, simple go to
              adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner, sign in with your
              Google Account, and click on the first option which will
              let you search for new keywords, by using a phrase.</p>
            <p>I will research for “Snapchat” related keywords, you can
              also decide some other parameters of your choice, and
              click on get ideas.</p>
            <p>Make sure the “Keyword Ideas” tab is displayed.</p>
            <p>A List of keywords with several values will be shown.</p>
            <p>The first 4 columns is what you will care about the most
              right now.</p>
            <p>The “Keyword” column will show you the terms people are
              actually using in Google.com to search Snapchat Related
              content in this case.</p>
            <p>The Average Monthly Searches column, will tell you the
              average number of searches for each keyword. You can use
              this information to see how popular each keyword is.</p>
            <p>The competition column, reflects the number of
              advertisers using that keyword in their Paid Google
              Advertising campaigns, which is an important indicator of
              the commercial intention of a keyword.</p>
            <p>The Suggested Bid column, is the recommended bid for a
              keyword idea, which is what those advertisers might be
              paying to Google in their Paid Google Advertising
              campaigns. It is another important indicator of the
              commercial intention of a keyword.</p>
            <p>Those 3 last columns can help you find what is called
              Money Keywords, or keywords that can bring you profits.</p>
            <p>You can click on the top of the Average Monthly Searches
              column, to sort them from high to low, and see the most
              used keywords by users.</p>
            <p>The idea is to research for Money keywords that have as
              many words as possible, a lot of searches, high
              competition, and a high suggested bid.</p>
            <p>And why to look for a keyword with a lot of words on it.
              Well, simply because there will be other people trying to
              do exactly what you are doing, ranking YouTube videos with
              your money keyword.</p>
            <p>So as long as the keyword phrase is, the less people will
              be trying to rank a video with your exact keyword.</p>
            <p>After some time spent in research, I decided to use this
              keyword.</p>
            <p>Now let’s create a live stream event to rank our YouTube
              Live video in top of Google and YouTube with our money
              keyword. </p>
            <p>To create a live event with your money keyword, just go
              to your “creator studio” dashboard on YouTube and click on
              the “live streaming” tab, then on “event”. </p>
            <p>Now, click on “new live event”. A new window with two
              tabs will open: “basic info” and “advanced settings”. </p>
            <p>In the “basic info” tab is where you will introduce your
              money keyword as the name of your event. </p>
            <p>There are three pieces of data that YouTube and Google
              will use to rank your video: title, description and tags.</p>
            <p>You will only need to enter your money keyword on each
              corresponding field. </p>
            <p>Once you enter the basic info for your event click on “go
              live now”.</p>
            <p>You will then wait until everything gets set up.</p>
            <p>Click on Start Broadcast.</p>
            <p>And that’s about it.</p>
            <p>You can now see if your video is ranking on top of the
              first page of results both on Google and YouTube.</p>
            <p>Simply go to Google.com and type your money keyword in
              the search bar. </p>
            <p>As you can see, our video is in the top of Google, in
              just a few seconds.</p>
            <p>And if I click on it, I will be redirected to the live
              stream happening right now.</p>
            <p>Now let’s take a look at YouTube.com.</p>
            <p>As you can see, here’s our newly scheduled live event
              video featuring its thumbnail, and our money keyword.</p>
            <p>And if I click on it, you can see the same Live stream. </p>
            <p>Awesome! right?</p>
            <p>Make use of this neat and simple trick to rank on top of
              the two leading content engines on the entire internet at
              the same time, and with money keywords.</p>
