            <p>Quick-Top-Ranking Tricks By using Product Launches</p>
            <p>What if I can show you a way where you can rank YouTube
              Live Videos in literally seconds, with keywords that will
              become highly searched money keywords in a specific day
              you can know in advance?</p>
            <p>Yeah, that is absolutely possible with Product Launches.</p>
            <p>In simple terms, a Product Launch, is the debut of a
              product into the market. A product launch is the point at
              which potential buyers first have access to a new product
              entering into the market. In this case, the online market.</p>
            <p>With that said, the name of the product to be launched
              can be considered as a potential money keyword, and
              besides that, the launch is not happening just yet, that
              money keyword has absolutely no competition, because no
              other people have created a YouTube Video about it yet. </p>
            <p>Making you the first one.</p>
            <p>But still, it’s important for you to notice in advance if
              there already is a YouTube Video ranking in the top of
              Google with the money keyword of the product launch you
              are about to schedule in your coming stream event.</p>
            <p>If not, this is your golden chance to be the first one
              and claim that top stop of Google and YouTube before the
              launch day.</p>
            <p>If you Google Product Launch Calendar, you will find
              several options to pick from.</p>
            <p>Muncheye.com, is a very popular Product Launch
              Notification Page, where top online marketers post their
              coming product launches.</p>
            <p>Jvnewswatch.com, is another very popular Product Launch
              listing website.</p>
            <p>There are 3 different things you will be looking for.</p>
            <p>First of all, you will be looking for what is known as
              the JV Page, where you will be able to get all the
              information about the launch coming up. Make sure you pick
              a launch that will come several days after the date you
              are searching for.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you will need to find the Product Name, which
              is the money keyword you will use to create your live
              stream.</p>
            <p>Now will be a good time to do some basic research and
              make sure there are no other videos ranking with the
              product name you are about to use.</p>
            <p>If you see a YouTube video ranking with that product name
              followed with the word “Review”. To make it easy for you,
              it will be better for you look for another product to
              launch. </p>
            <p>And thirdly, you will set up everything needed to get
              your affiliate link, as well as advertising tools you can
              use to promote that product launch and make commissions
              for every sale generated for your advertising efforts.</p>
            <p>There is no point on ranking a video, and getting a lot
              of people to watch it, and not giving them the chance to
              buy the product, and generating an affiliate commission
              for you, because of it.</p>
            <p>Now it’s time to create your Live Stream for it.</p>
            <p>Go to your “creator studio” and click on the “live
              streaming” tab and then on “event”.</p>
            <p>Click on “new live event”.</p>
            <p>Enter the name of your product in the “title”.</p>
            <p>For this we advise you to use the Product Name, but
              another awesome idea is to include the word “Review” at
              the end of it, as it is something a lot of people search
              for, before deciding to buy the product.</p>
            <p>For the Date, you have 2 options.</p>
            <p>Option 1: you can schedule a live stream to go live on
              the launch date and time. That live stream invitation will
              be ranked in the top as a reminder, and will stay there,
              until you go live together with the Product Launch. You
              can add cards to that Stream Invitation inside the Events
              dashboard.</p>
            <p>Option 2: you can have a live stream Today and Now,
              giving your honest review about the product, and also
              letting people know the date when the product will be
              available for purchase.</p>
            <p>Once you finish that live stream, that live stream will
              be ranked in the top as a video, and will stay there too.
              So, people can have a review of the product right away.
              And also on the launch day, you can have that video
              already ranked there, before your competitors.</p>
            <p>Either way works awesome. It depends on what you prefer.</p>
            <p>For the description, it is very important to use the
              exact money keyword you used in the title, but also don’t
              forget to include your affiliate link. So, viewers can
              click on it, buy the product, and you make a commission
              for every sale.</p>
            <p>For the “tags”, just add your money keyword exactly, then
              click on “go live now”.</p>
            <p>Awesome.</p>
            <p>Go to Google and YouTube and check how your Live Stream
              is ranking on top.</p>
            <p>As you can see, the video is ranked on top in Google, and
              in YouTube.</p>
            <p>In the coming video, you will learn how to use your
              already ranked videos, and replace them with a Live
              Stream, for any special occasion.</p>
