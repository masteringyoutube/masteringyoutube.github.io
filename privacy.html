            yours.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p> 2. HOW WE GATHER INFORMATION FROM USERS? </p>
      <p> How we collect and store information depends on the pages you
        are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate
        and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to
        provide information when you register for access to certain
        portions of our Website, create a User account, request certain
        features, such as e-mail newsletters or when you make a payment.
        Like most websites, masteringyoutube also collects information
        automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may
        be transparent to our visitors and Users. For example, we may
        log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use “cookies”
        technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit
        (for more information, please view our separate Cookie Policy).
        Among other things, the cookies may store your username and
        password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information
        each time you visit, or may control the number of times you
        encounter a particular tutorial, part of the CPA Marketing
        Genius Program or other part of the Website. As we use
        additional technologies, we may also gather information through
        other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us
        with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse
        to accept cookies. </p>
      <p> 3. WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? </p>
      <p> Like other websites, we collect information to enhance your
        visit and deliver more individualized content. We respect your
        privacy and do not share your information with anyone, except in
        cases when that proves necessary. <br>
        Aggregate information and information that does not personally
        identify you, may be used in many ways. For example,
        masteringyoutube may combine information about your usage
        patterns on the Website with similar information obtained from
        other users to help enhance our site and Services (e.g., to
        learn which pages are visited the most or what features Users
        find the most attractive). This information does not include any
        information about you and does not allow anyone to identify you
        individually. We may use personally identifiable information,
        collected on the Website, to communicate with you about your
        registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service
        and Privacy Policy; services and products offered by or through
        the Website; and other topics we think you might find of
        interest. Personally identifiable information collected by
        masteringyoutube may also be used for other purposes, including
        but not limited to Website administration, troubleshooting,
        processing of e-commerce transactions and other communications
        with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support
        for the operation of our Website – our Web hosting service for
        example – may have access to such information. We will use your
        information only as permitted by law. We may also disclose your
        information in response to a court order, at other times when we
        believe we are reasonably required to do so by the applicable
        law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to
        us, and/or to law enforcement authorities, whenever we deem it
        appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you
        with notice prior to disclosure in such cases. <br>
        All payment card transactions made through the PayPal interface
        and are processed using a secure online payment gateway (Secure
        Socket Layer (SSL) technology) that encrypts your card details
        in a secure hosting environment. We do not hold your payment
        card details on the masteringyoutube server. </p>
      <p> 4. REVIEWING, CHANGING OR DELETING INFORMATION </p>
      <p> If you would like to review, change or delete personal data we
        have collected from you or you had submitted or permanently
        delete your account, please contact us. For more information
        regarding the termination or deletion of your information,
        please refer to Section 8: Termination of this Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p> 5. ACCESSING &amp; CORRECTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. </p>
      <p> We take reasonable steps to accurately record the personal
        information that you provide to us, as well as any subsequent
        updates. </p>
      <p> We encourage you to review, update, and correct the personal
        information that we maintain about you. You may request that we
        delete personal data about you that is inaccurate, incomplete,
        irrelevant for legitimate purposes, or are being processed in a
        way which infringes any applicable legal requirements. </p>
      <p> 6. SECURITY: HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION? </p>
      We have implemented appropriate measures in the form of various
      technical, physical and other means, including, but not limited to
      measures regarding the security of out electronic systems and
      databases, locks, racks, cases and other devices and access
      controlling systems, fire-notifying and fire extinguishing
      systems. These means aim at improving the integrity and security
      of the personal information that we collect and maintain. However,
      please be advised that even the best security measures cannot
      guarantee the full elimination of all risks. If we learn of any
      violation, breach or danger to our security systems breach, then
      we will attempt to notify you electronically so that timely and
      appropriate protective steps can be taken. Apart from informing
      you via e-mail, we may post a notice through the Website if a
      security breach occurs.<span style="background-color: #00FFFF"><br>
        <br>
      </span>
      <p> 7. CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA </p>
      <p> Other Users may be able to identify you, or associate you with
        your account, if you include your personal information in any
        content you post or make publicly available. </p>
      <p> 8. TERMINATION </p>
      <p> As mentioned, you may at any time review or change the
        personal information we maintain about you by contacting
        masteringyoutube. Upon your request, we will delete your contact
        information and personal data from our active databases. <br>
        This Privacy Policy is effective until terminated by either
        party. If you no longer agree to be bound by this Privacy
        Policy, you must cease the use of the masteringyoutube Website.
        If you are dissatisfied with masteringyoutube, its’ content, or
        any of these terms, conditions, and policies, your sole legal
        remedy is to discontinue using the Website. Masteringyoutube
        reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to and
        use of the Website, or parts of them, without notice, if we
        believe, in our sole discretion that such use is in violation of
        any applicable law, or harmful to our interests or the interests
        of another person or entity, or where masteringyoutube has
        reasons to believe that their use is in violation of this
        Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use. </p>
      <p> 9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY </p>
      <p> Masteringyoutube does not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under the age of 14. If we learn that
        we have personal information on a child under the age of 14, we
        will delete that information from our servers. <br>
        Masteringyoutube encourages parents to go online with their
        kids. <br>
        Some tips to help make a child’s online experience safer: Teach
        kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a
        parent or responsible adult. This Includes name, address, phone,
        school, etc. Know the sites your kids are visiting and which
        sites are appropriate. Look for website privacy policies. Know
        how your child’s information is treated. </p>
      <p> 10. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY<br>

        Policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for
        changes. Your use of the services after any such amendment or
        change in the Privacy Policy shall be deemed as your express
        acceptance to such amended/changed Privacy Policy and an assent
        to be bound by such changed/amended Privacy Policy. Information
        collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used
        according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the
        information was collected. </p>
