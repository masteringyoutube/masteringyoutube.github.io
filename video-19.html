            <p>Tips to Improve Live Streaming</p>
            <p>There is always going to be room for improvement, and
              attention to detail can take you to experience success
              live you have never had before.</p>
            <p>In a previous video we told you how important it is to
              take care of all the small things, and in this video we
              will help you to build a laundry list of tips to improve
              your live streaming.</p>
            <p>We really recommend you to take notes on this, then make
              them into a list in the order that best works for you, and
              stick it to your work space wall.</p>
            <p>Write it down, print it or carve it, as long as you do
              this check list before going live until it becomes second
              nature to you.</p>
            <p>Use a cable connection instead of Wi-Fi:</p>
            <p>Your internet connection is as important to your live
              streams as your talent, because if your live stream fails
              because of faulty network problems, well, nobody will be
              able to see you.</p>
            <p>Connecting the machine that you are going to use to
              broadcast your live stream directly to a cable connection
              instead of Wi-Fi is better because you will skip the many
              problems often associated with Wi-Fi connections.</p>
            <p>Slow signal, interruptions, and lag can be severely
              alleviated by connecting directly through your broadband
              cable. If you can’t connect directly, try to get as close
              to the wireless signal as possible.</p>
            <p>Be consistent</p>
            <p>Don’t promise your viewers to show them something that
              you will not. Even something as innocent as teasing
              something incredible with special effects and dramatic
              words and delivering a bare bone version of that can feel
              like betrayal to your viewers, so don’t go over the top.</p>
            <p>Being consistent also means to be disciplined. This might
              not be a job to you, but to your viewers it might well be;
              think of them as your consumers. Be on time, don’t show
              yourself in a bad mood and don’t you ever give them less
              than they have come to expect.</p>
            <p>Always test</p>
            <p>We might be repeating ourselves here, but it bears weight
              to be mentioned again.</p>
            <p>Test everything before going live.</p>
            <p>Test your equipment periodically.</p>
            <p>Be organized</p>
            <p>Being organized works two mindsets: being organized in
              your physical space and being organized with your work.</p>
            <p>The first mindset refers to being organized with your
              equipment, your cables, the room or place from where you
              broadcast, etc.</p>
            <p>The second mindset refers to being organized in your
              goals and in your schedule. You cannot present a great
              live stream each week if you intend to rush it. Take your
              time to think of and organize your ideas.</p>
            <p>Things can change for the better during the creative
              process. </p>
            <p>Backup your broadcasts</p>
            <p>If you start checking around, you will realize that many
              broadcasters have monetized their live streams by selling
              them as video packages. </p>
            <p>Remember that this is your production, and if you produce
              something of enough quality and value to your viewers,
              believe us when we say that they will want to buy it in
              the long run, especially if they are newcomers to your
              material!</p>
            <p>Center your broadcasts around interaction</p>
            <p>We are not talking about simply leaving a comment or a
              quick message during live chat sessions, we mean real
              interaction with your viewers.</p>
            <p>Promote an occasional giveaway, highlight comments from
              the chat session, greet people entering the chat, and be
              prepared to get tough on spammers and disrespectful
              viewers.</p>
            <p>Standing up like that for your fans will help you to grow
              your audience. </p>
            <p>Keep these tips handy and they will become as natural to
              you as clicking on the “start streaming” button!</p>
