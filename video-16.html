            <p>Promoting your Live Event During the event</p>
            <p>In our last video we showed you the ways in which you
              could get the word about your event out there before it
              started, all in the name of teasing it to the biggest
              number of people and, most importantly, getting them
              hooked until the day of the event.</p>
            <p>Now you got all those people showing up for your live
              stream, and you know that you did a great job, so
              congratulations! You know that you have proven to yourself
              that you have what it takes to make this a success. Now go
              get them!</p>
            <p>But wait, is it really enough? You built up momentum and
              got lots of people to show up for your live stream, but
              what about the people that weren't mesmerized by your
              teasers, and what about all the people that didn’t hear of
              your event, but could be watching it instead of doing
              whatever they are doing?</p>
            <p>You have to act on it, that’s what! The people that are
              not currently watching your live stream are equally as
              important as the people that you attracted just by
              teasing. And the good thing about it is that, by watching
              you perform, they will get a real taste of what your event
              is all about!</p>
            <p>Think of it as the difference between watching a sports
              car running and actually getting to drive it. You want as
              many people inviting others to watch your event as
              possible, so let’s take a look at some things that you can
              do to reach them.</p>
            <p>Set your event as a trailer for your channel</p>
            <p>This is a great customization tool to use to attract
              people that are not yet subscribed to your channel, the
              advantage here being that they can see the “now live” icon
              in the recommended section, and if they access your
              channel, your live stream will play automatically. </p>
            <p>What makes that great as well is that a person is very,
              very likely to keep watching a video if they know that it
              is a live broadcast. Even the “now live” icon is usually
              enough to drive people to watch your content, and if they
              like it, they will share.</p>
            <p>For those already subscribed to your channel, a preview
              of your live stream will be shown in the “what to watch
              next” area by the right side of their player. </p>
            <p>Create a “real time” trailer for social media</p>
            <p>It is very, very important that you create a short, real
              time trailer for your event minutes before starting your
              broadcast to upload it to Facebook.</p>
            <p>Those not on YouTube will most likely be on Facebook, so
              make sure that you reach them there as well!</p>
            <p>Upload your video with a really short description, make
              an invitation to participate and share the link to your
              stream in the comments.</p>
            <p>The good thing about this strategy is that people will
              promote the trailer for you while you are live, so it’s
              not intrusive and is super effective!</p>
            <p>Promote engagement</p>
            <p>Read the comments feed and interact with your audience
              from time to time.</p>
            <p>Making a direct mention to a user can prompt sharing, so
              make sure to engage and entertain your watchers by
              interacting with them.</p>
            <p>That will also help to make them come back for future
              events!</p>
            <p>Update your channel’s appearance </p>
            <p>Change your profile picture and your background image to
              match the theme of your event.</p>
            <p>Do this one day before your event goes live.</p>
            <p>This will give your event an aura of something fresh and
              new, something worth sharing!</p>
            <p>Remember, the trick here is socialization! if you can
              offer your subscribers and would be watchers reasons to
              share your content and bring in more people during the
              event, you have to entertain them, make them part of the
              show, making them want to bring more people along!</p>
